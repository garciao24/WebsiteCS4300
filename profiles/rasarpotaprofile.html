	    <h3>About me:</h3>

	    Helping the community with my spare time is what I enjoy!  I am a Information Technology User Support Specialist
		as well as a senior CS student here at the University of Houston-Downtown. My hobbies include playing guitar, biking,
		kayaking, playing video games with friends, as well as watching/playing football and basketball.
		<p>As a Senior Web Developer, my job is to stay updating our website on CDC updates as well as overviewing the contact us page 
		for any questions or inquiry. I understand that COVID-19 has put many people in hard situations 
		mentally, physically, and financially.  We hope that we could help as many people as possible in this time 
		of crisis.  Our goals at this non-profit organization is to help lessen the burden the panadmic has placed
		on this world.
