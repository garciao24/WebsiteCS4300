              <p>As of today Nov 27 (4pm), there are 187,867 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Houston/Harris County and 2,418 deaths. A total of 164,743 patients have recovered. The positivity rate is 9.6%. - <b>Harris County Public Health</b></p>
             <h2>November 14, 2020</h2>
             <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, while the number of undernourished people, currently estimated at nearly 690 million, could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year. - <b>WHO</b></p>
              <h2>November 13, 2020</h2> 
              <p>Nationally, surveillance indicators tracking levels of SARS-CoV-2 virus circulation and associated illnesses have been increasing since September. The percentage of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza and COVID-19 (PIC) increased throughout the month of October. Both COVID-19 related hospitalizations and PIC mortality for the most recent weeks are expected to increase as more data are received. - <b> CDC</b></p>
             <h2>October 31, 2020</h2> 
              <p>Nationally, the overall percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, increased from 10.8% during week 45 to 11.9% during week 46. Percent positivity increased among all age groups. Regionally, the percentages of respiratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 increased in nine of the ten HHS regions. - <b>CDC</b></p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <h2>October 26, 2020</h2> 
              <p>Since the week ending September 19 (MMWR week 38), weekly hospitalization rates among all age groups combined are increasing. Based on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to PIC for week 46 was 10.7% and, while declining compared with week 45 (14.4%), remains above the epidemic threshold. The weekly percentages of deaths due to PIC increased throughout October and are expected to increase for the most recent weeks as additional data are reported. Hospitalization rates for the most recent week are also expected to increase as additional data are reported. - <b>CDC</b></p>
              <h2>October 25, 2020</h2>
              <p>Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:
                Fever or chills
                Cough
                Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
                Fatigue
                Muscle or body aches
                Headache
                New loss of taste or smell
                Sore throat
                Congestion or runny nose
                Nausea or vomiting
                Diarrhea
                Look for emergency warning signs for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately:
                Trouble breathing
                Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
                New confusion
                Inability to wake or stay awake
                Bluish lips or face - <b> CDC</b></p>
                <h2> June 15, 2020</h2>
                <p>Today, FDA revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) that allowed for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated to the Strategic National Stockpile to be used to treat certain hospitalized patients with COVID-19 when a clinical trial was unavailable, or participation in a clinical trial was not feasible. Based on its ongoing analysis of the EUA and emerging scientific data, the FDA determined that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA. Additionally, in light of ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other potential serious side effects, the known and potential benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the authorized use. The agency issued a Press Release and posted FAQs about this action. - <b>FDA</b></p>
